# Documentation

As I'm building this, adding random notes and stuff here.
Mostly architectural documentation for now to help me remember why I built it the way I did and what I did sacrifice along the way.

## Data Model
[[data-model.md]] The data model is a key concept in a system like this, and there are many considerations and possibly tradeoffs.
